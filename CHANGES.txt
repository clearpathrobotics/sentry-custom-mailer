Version 1.0.4: Fixed bug caused by get_send_to returning email addresses 
    instead of user IDs - replaced calls to it with directly looking up the
    'email' option of the plugin.
Version 1.0.3: Fixed last line of plugin.py to account for name change
Version 1.0.2: Renamed from Sentry Mailer to Sentry Custom Mailer, changed from 
    copying Sentry Mail to inheriting it, cleaning up and licensing
Version 1.0.1: Removed register call in plugin.py to avoid duplicate plugin in
    sentry admin interface
Version 1.0.0: Initial Release
